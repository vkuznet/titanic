# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

DATASCI 450: Deriving Knowledge from Data at Scale
Authors: V. Kuznetsov, J. Arturo Covarrubias

## Problem statement

Predict survival on the Titanic

### Data analysis

We used all available tools for this data analysis, including R, Weka, Python.
The data clean-up and preparation was done in R, the modeling was done both in R and Weka.
The bash shell scripts and python were used for batching purposes (see later).

The team **valya** was registered by one of us (V. Kuznetsov) under the kaggle web site:

### Part 1

In section we cover model description, answering the following questions:

- what feature looks most promising for modeling
- do you need to deal with missing values?
- scale the attributes
- compare with multiple classifiers
- kaggle model

We started from data exploration by plotting various attributes from provided
data set. The most interested plots are shown below:

    <img class=center src=images/mosaic.png />
    Fig 1. Mosaic plot of survival rate for Class, Sex and Age attributes.
</div>

The data survival rate plot, see Fig 1, clearly indicated that
survival rate increases significantly for females and children.
Most children were in 2nd and 3rd class. Most females in first and second
classes, while only half of them survived from the third class.

Then we looked at different class distributions. Here is class vs SibSp and Parch
attributes:

- screen-shots
- model strategy
- model ensembles

## Kaggle models

The initial submission was made using Weka RandomForest model. We received
0.73206 score with position 5780:

The second submission was due to assignment of Age based on review of
SibSp and Parch attributes as well as adding CabinId, TicketId variables. The later was
just numerical values of Cabin and Ticket factors in R. For this submission we used
R RandomForest implementation which scored almost 95% accuracy on the training set.
At this step we jumped to position 2829 with score 0.77512:

Kaggle submission 3 and 4 were based on improvements with cabin assignment and
matching ticket ids with cabin categories. At this stage we run in parallel R
KSVM (with RBFKernel) and R RandomForest ML algorithms. Due to these changes we
jumped up 2154 points in a leadership board with score 0.78947 and position 678:

Kaggle submission 5, 6 and 7 were mostly fine-tuning of SVM and RandomForest models.
They did not improve our final score.

Kaggle submission 8 was based on introduction of new Married attributed, which
was assigned as following: 1 for names with Miss. in them, 2 for Mrs., 3 for
Mr.  and zero otherwise. The RF model shown an percentage improvement and we
submit our results. On a leadership board we jumped up 1.435% to score 0.80383
and position 145:
